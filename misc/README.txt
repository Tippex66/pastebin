- spindle.profile.js
  This is a build profile for the spindle application. 
  
  To create a custom build, first copy the public/js-src/spindle and
  public/js-src/paste directories to your Dojo source build. Then, place the
  spindle.profile.js file in the util/buildscripts/profiles/ directory of your
  Dojo source distribution. From the util/buildscripts directory, execute the
  line provided in the header of the profile to create a custom build.  You can
  then use this custom build in place of the shipped JS source.
