- Import bugapp into Spindle module
  - Create comment/comments objects
  - Refactor url() usage
    - Should use baseUrl() instead
  - Refactor views
    - Determine optimal UI for app
      - split BorderContainer (top and center)
        - top: Tab container (tabs on left)
          - Open bugs
          - Resolved bugs
          - All bugs
          - When user logged in:
            - open bugs you own
            - open bugs you reported
        - center (bottom)
          - three options:
            - Current bug only
            - tab container
              - closable tabs
              - 1 bug per tab
            - split
              - left: tree of bugs that have been opened
              - center: current bug
- layout builders per module
  - JS that updates main content pane either 
    - from HREF
    - creating basic structure
  - Selecting link from different app should setup main pane as above, and
    populate
- Pastebin improvements
  - Add caching subscriber to Paste model (create cached view)
    - Use Zend_Cache to cache pastes
      - using expiration from individual pastes
      - API would pull from cache, and not directly from filesystem
