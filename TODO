- Better link/view generation
  - MVC should setup tabs with content only for the currently selected tab. Tab
    handler should detect the current tab and update the URL accordingly.
  - Use Paginator for active view
- Refactor to allow easy usage without JS
  - No ajax in MVC
  - API directory
    - versioned (v1, v2, etc)
    - bootstrap
      - sets up env constants
      - instantiates initialization plugin
      - uses HTTP request to get baseUrl
    - endpoints
      - /active -> active.php
        Endpoint for QueryReadStore.
      - /jsonrpc -> jsonrpc.php
        Endpoint for submitting pastes and followups (JSON-RPC)
      - /xmlrpc -> xmlrpc.php
        Endpoint for submitting pastes and followups (XML-RPC)
      - /about.html, /active-grid.html, /new-paste.html, paste-<id>.html, followup-<id>.html -> /content.php
        If HTML file does not exist, then it creates it via the Paste_Content
        model and writes to disk.
