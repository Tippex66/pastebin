<h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>
    This is a public pastebin. To quote <a href="http://pastebin.ca/">Pastebin</a>, 
    a pastebin "is a public place to paste things (primarily configurations and
    source code), but it is really open to pretty much any text format. The idea is
    to paste large items here when talking online to someone, or even when holding
    a phone conversation to paste the little things that are hard to explain."
</p>

<p>
    All pastes are public, so you are encouraged not to post anything of a
    sensitive nature. However, this particular implementation does not aggregate or
    list posts, and all posts receive a random unique identifier, which should help
    to preserve a certain amount of anonymity. By default, pastes expire in 1 hour,
    though you may configure the interval and/or disable expiration as desired.
